# Pull Request: Create Project Folder Structure

## Description
This pull request sets up the initial folder structure for the A2SV Backend Blog Starter Project. It organizes the codebase according to clean architecture principles, making it easier to scale and maintain.

## Changes
- Added top-level directories: `cmd/`, `internal/`, `api/`, and `docs/`.
- Created subdirectories for domain, entity, handler, infrastructure, usecase, and contract layers.
- Added placeholder files where necessary to ensure directories are tracked by version control.
- Updated documentation to reflect the new structure.

## Motivation
Establishing a clear and scalable folder structure from the start helps:
- Maintain code organization
- Support clean architecture
- Improve collaboration among team members

## Checklist
- [x] Folders created as per clean architecture
- [x] Placeholder files added
- [x] Documentation updated

## Related Issues

## Additional Notes
- No business logic or implementation is included in this PRâ€”only the folder structure and placeholders.
- Please review the structure and suggest any improvements.
