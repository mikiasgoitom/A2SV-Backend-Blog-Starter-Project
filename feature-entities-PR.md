# Pull Request: Feature - Entities

## Description
This pull request introduces the core entity definitions for the A2SV Backend Blog Starter Project. These entities represent the main business objects and will be used throughout the application.

## Changes
- Added entity files for core domain models (e.g., User, Blog, Token, AIQuery).
- Defined struct types and basic fields for each entity.
- Ensured each entity is placed in the appropriate package and follows Go conventions.

## Motivation
Defining entities early provides a strong foundation for the rest of the application, ensuring consistency and clarity in how business objects are represented and manipulated.

## Checklist
- [x] Entity structs created for all core models
- [x] Fields and types reviewed for accuracy
- [x] Package structure and naming conventions followed

## Related Issues
N/A

## Additional Notes
- This PR only includes entity definitionsâ€”no business logic or database integration is included.
- Please review the struct fields and suggest any changes or additions.
